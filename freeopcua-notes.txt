= 1. TYPE PROBLEM  =
====================
GOAL
**********
A TypedNode C++ object, when instantiated, should do the following things:
	1. Create it's own type node in the address space, if not present yet (ObjectType, VariableType)
	2. Create the node representing the TypedNode object (a Variable, Object)
	3. Create a HasTypeDefinition Reference from the node created in (2), to the node created in (1)
	

PROBLEM 1
**********
The creation of the node representing the TypedNode is done in a base class constructor specific for the NodeClass (BaseVariable, BaseObject, ...).
Naturally, the creation of the HasTypeDefinition reference should also happen in the constructor of the TypedNode base class.
However, the type node is created in the derived class' constructor, but the base class constructor is called before the derived class constructor. 
This means the reference cannot be created yet because the type node (the target of the reference) hasn't been created yet. 
==>SOLUTION 1: Create the HasTypeDefinition reference in the derived class constructor instead.

PROBLEM 2
**********
SOLUTION 1 introduces a new problem. Consider the following OPC-UA type hierarchy:

	BaseVariableType --> BaseDataVariableType --> DataItemType --> AnalogItemType

The corresponding C++ class hierarchy would be:

	Node --> TypedNode --> BaseVariable --> BaseDataVariable --> DataItem --> AnalogItem

According to the above explanation (see GOAL), when you instantiate an AnalogItem C++ object, the following should happen
	1. Create the AnalogItemType node in the address space (if not existing yet)
	2. Create an AnalogItem object node in the address space
	3. Create a HasTypeDefinition Reference from the AnalogItem object to the AnalogItemType node.
However, since AnalogItem derives from DataItem, when you instantiate AnalogItem, DataItem's constructor is also called,
which creates the DataItemType type node (if not existing yet) and adds a HasTypeDefinition Reference to this DataItemType type node.
This happens in each constructor in the inheritance tree. 
The result is that you get an AnalogItem node with HasTypeDefinition references to AnalogItemType, DataItemType, BaseDataVariableType and BaseVariableType. 
Obviously there should only be a reference to the AnalogItemType Node.
==>SOLUTION 2: 1. Add an argument of type bool with a default value (bSetType). This argument indicates whether the typednode being instantiated should 
				  add a HasTypeDefinition reference. The default value for this argument is true.
			   2. Derived classes should call the base class constructor with this argument set to false and add the HasTypeDefinition reference
				  themself.			   
			   
PROBLEM 3
***********
SOLUTION 2 introduces a new problem: clients of the code can instantiate TypedNodes that will have no HasTypeDefinition reference
by passing bSetType = false.
SOLUTION 3: Make the constructor that takes the bSetType argument protected and 
			add create an overloaded constructor that doesn't take the default parameter, put
			delegates to the protected one with bSetType = true.
			This way derived classes can still call the protected base constructor, as well as
			provide an interface that hides the optional parameter.
			
			
====================================
= 2. INSTANCE DECLARATION PROBLEM  =
====================================
When a TypedNode is instantiated it creates it's own type node(s) in the address space.
Part of this is to create objects, variables, properties that are part of the type definition: so called instance declarations.
These instance declarations are objects, variables or properties that differ from actual
instances by having a hierarchical reference to a type node (e.g. ObjectType) rather than another instance.

For example, consider a class LoraNode. 
When instantiated it will create the following type node (if not existing yet) in the address space

LoraNodeType --hasProperty--> DevEUI	(1)

Then it will create an instance of a LoraNodeType in the address space:

MyLoraNode --hasProperty--> DevEUI		(2)

The DevEUI Property node in (1) only differs from the one in (2) by:

1. NodeId attribute
2. The source of its parent reference

We should add a new constructor that takes the following arguments: newNodeId, parentNodeId, parentReferenceType, pInstanceDeclaration
This constructor uses the pInstanceDeclaration pointer to get the attribute values that are the same for both objects.
